Create a pull request using the GitHub CLI (gh).

- The title should be the same as the first commit message
- Inspect the diff to understand the changes and generate a short description
- The description should be terse, do not add lots of details, just a very brief summary

Example:

gh pr create $flags -t "Add QR code scanner" -b "## Description\n\nImplement QR code scanner in the account settings page."

Notes:
- If the branch is alpha, beta, charlie, delta, or echo, start by running \`gn "commit message"\`. This will rename the branch and commit the changes. After this, continue with the PR creation.
