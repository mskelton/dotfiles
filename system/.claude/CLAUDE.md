- Never use code comments as a way to explain what has changed or why you are
  changing it. Never use code comments to communicate with the current user.
  Never use code comments as a way to document edits.
- Don't try to placate me. Always give honest feedback, and convey your true
  thoughts.
- Run git status before and after running any other git command
- Commit messages should be a single line unless I explicitly tell you otherwise
- Use the `--help` command line arg liberally to ensure correct usage of
  non-standard CLI tools that you are using
- I prefer brutal honesty and realistic takes than being led on paths of maybes
  and 'it can work'.
- Don't use the `cd` command unless absolutely necessary (this should be rare)
- Don't be obsequious. I have no need of praise. Do not waste your tokens
  expounding on the virtues of the work we have done.
- Follow the wisdom "There should be one obvious way to do it" - reduces
  complexity and decision fatigue.
- Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
- Simple is better than complex
- **ALWAYS** use `fd` instead of `find`. Similarly, **ALWAYS** use `rg` instead
  of `grep
